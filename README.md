Overview
The SneakE project contains various files that appear to be related to a proof of concept for cybersecurity testing, ethical hacking demonstrations, or similar activities. This repository includes source code, executables, and a planning document that should be reviewed with caution.

Disclaimer
Use these files responsibly. Any unauthorized use of this code or associated executables is strictly prohibited and may violate local, state, or international laws.

File Descriptions
1. backdoor.c
Description:
This C source file implements a backdoor functionality. It is likely intended for demonstration or analysis of security vulnerabilities.

Usage:
This file must be compiled before use. The resulting executable might provide unauthorized remote access to the host machine for testing purposes.

2. malware.exe
Description:
A precompiled executable that appears to contain malware-like functionality. Handle this file with extreme caution. It is recommended to run this only in an isolated, controlled environment (e.g., a virtual machine).

Usage:
Not recommended for use without understanding its full impact. Perform a detailed analysis in a sandboxed environment.

3. malwareplan.txt
Description:
A text file outlining the intent, purpose, or strategy behind the "malware" in this project. It provides context for the other files and is essential for understanding the overall goals of the project.

Usage:
Read the file to comprehend the objectives and methodology.

4. server
Description:
An executable file likely related to the server-side operations of the backdoor or malware project.

Usage:
Examine its behavior in a secure, monitored environment.

5. server.c
Description:
The C source file for the server executable. This file provides insight into the server-side logic implemented in the project.

Usage:
Compile and study this file if necessary. Modify or run it only in an environment designed for cybersecurity research.

Instructions
Setup Environment:
Prepare a virtual machine or sandboxed environment with network isolation to prevent unintended consequences.

Compile Source Files:
Use a C compiler like gcc to compile backdoor.c and server.c:

bash
Copy code
gcc backdoor.c -o backdoor
gcc server.c -o server
Analyze Behavior:

Study the source code to understand its functionality.
Use tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, or system logs to observe any network or system activities.
Read malwareplan.txt:
Review this file to understand the purpose and methodology of the project.

Run with Caution:
If executing any file, ensure the environment is secure and that you have permission to analyze or test the project.

Notes and Recommendations
Always use such files within the boundaries of ethical cybersecurity research.
Avoid deploying these programs on live systems or networks.
Educate others on potential risks and mitigation strategies for similar threats.
